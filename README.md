# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Python

This project showcases exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and feature engineering on a public credit card transaction dataset. It demonstrates techniques to identify fraud signals using Python, with tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## 🔍 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Contains anonymized features (`V1` to `V28`), transaction amounts, timestamps, and a binary `Class` label (1 = fraud, 0 = non-fraud).

## 💡 What This Project Covers

- Loading and inspecting the dataset
- Missing values and statistical summary
- Data balancing (fraud vs. non-fraud)
- Distribution analysis of transaction amounts
- Visualizations of feature correlations and patterns
- Feature scaling and sample modeling prep

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python (3.8+)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (optional, for further modeling)

## 🚀 Motivation

This notebook is part of my technical portfolio and reflects real-world analytical tasks I've handled in fraud detection and AML domains using Python and dashboarding tools.
